# Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
This project explores the application of ML in medicine. Data is taken from the Kaggle, it is balanced data, and it has many features/variables as symptoms of a disease and the output variable as a disease.
## Task
Given the symptoms of a disease, we need to predict the disease.
## Steps to perform the task
1) Exploratory Data Analysis
2) Build model: Linear SVM, RBF kernel SVM, Random Forest, Gaussian Naive Bayes, KNN, and Decision Tree
3) Train the model
4) Improve model performance by optimizing hyperparameters using RFECV
5) Feature engineering and feature selection 
6) Combine the best-performing model
7) Test the combined model on test data

Hence, it solves the problem of identifying disease based on the symptoms.
